 ## Hi there üëã

<!-- I work at [Sea AI Lab](https://sail.sea.com/) <img src='./images/logo-sea-header-desktop.webp' style='width: 6em;'> as a research scientist now, leading the audio team and doing some fundamental audio-related research. We are [hiring researchers and engineers](https://career.sea.com/position/427) to work on TTS, music generation, speech translation and audio-driven talking face generation. If interested, feel free to email me at [renyi@sea.com](mailto:renyi@sea.com). -->

I'm Xiaolin Hu, pursuing Ph.D. at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/logo-gsai-header-desktop.png' style='width: 8em;'> , Renmin University of China (RUC). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yong Liu](https://liuyonggsai.github.io/). Currently I am a Research Intern at [Xiaomi's AI Lab](https://www.mi.com/miai) <img src='./images/mi-logo.jpeg' style="width: 1em;">, where I focus on Edge Large Language Models (LLMs), mentored by [Wei Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-liu-40a97a39/?originalSubdomain=cn) and [Jian Luan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jian-luan-58b5a428/?originalSubdomain=cn). Previously, I received my B.E. and M.E. degrees in communication and information system from Shanghai University in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Between 2018 and 2021, I collaborated with Prof. [Nicholas E. Buris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-buris-a974ba5/) as part of the Intelligent Multi-Input Multi-Output Systems (i-MIMOs) research group. Additionally, I gained research experience as an Intern at the [OPPO Research Institute](https://www.oppo.com/en/proposal/) <img src='./images/oppo-logo.png' style="width: 3em;"> from October 2020 to February 2021, under the mentorship of [Xianyue Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wuxianyue/) and [Tehuang Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tehuangliu/?originalSubdomain=cn). 

<!-- I graduated from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm), Zhejiang University (ÊµôÊ±üÂ§ßÂ≠¶Á´∫ÂèØÊ°¢Â≠¶Èô¢) with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University (ÊµôÊ±üÂ§ßÂ≠¶ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫ÁßëÂ≠¶‰∏éÊäÄÊúØÂ≠¶Èô¢) with a master's degree, advised by [Zhou Zhao (ËµµÊ¥≤)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborate with [Xu Tan (Ë∞≠Êó≠)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/), [Tao Qin (Áß¶Ê∂õ)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/) and [Tie-yan Liu (ÂàòÈìÅÂ≤©)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely.  -->


I am currently bridging LLMs and personal edge devices. With a long-term goal of contributing to a human-centered application ecosystem based on large models, I am particularly interested in:
(1) Science-Driven LLMs Training: Exploring the scientific principles of LLMs training and fine-tuning. 
(2) Personal Edge LLMs Serving: Developing efficient algorithms for LLMs on edge devices to enhance personalized services.
I won the [Shanghai University President Scholarship](https://news.shu.edu.cn/info/1021/47992.htm) (The highest honor among the scholarships at Shanghai University). 

<!-- I have a signal processing background, my current research interests include the theory and methods of Federated Learning and Optimization. -->

<!-- Her research expertise includes developing methods and tools to integrate AI with science, especially for dynamical systems and PDE-based simulations. 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published more than 30 papers  at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. -->
